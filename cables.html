              <h3>Connectors</h3>
              <p>
                The most important part of your cable is the connection. You can have the coolest cable in the world but if it doesn't connect
                 to your keyboard and computer, you will not be using it. Most custom boards have a USB-C connection to the board and probably and USB-A 
                 to the computer. Shown in the above photo, you can have an additional connection in the middle of the cable. Most commonly an aviator
                 cable is chosen. These connect together with serveral pins and give oportunities for most customizability.

              <h3>Custom Options</h3>
              <p>
                Creating a custom cable involeves a multitude of parts that can all have an indivdual color. 
                Paracord, sheathing, housing, skrink wrap, coiling, and cord connections are all customizable. 
                There are ways to make the cable yourself or you can go through an online shop and pick your colors and style in an a la carte fashion.
