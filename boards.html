              <h3>What is a PCB?</h3>
              <p>
                PCB stands for Printed Circuit Board. In other words, it is responsible for taking the inputs of the keys and sending that to your computer.
                The layout of the PCB must match the layout of the keyboard and the size. Usually in getting started kits, the PCB is automaticly included. 
                This is also the case for uncommonly shaped keyboards.

                <h3>North vs South facing LEDs</h3>
                <p>
                  The lighing (LEDs) is located on the PCB since this is the only keyboard component that connects to the power. 
                  The LED can either be placed above (North), or below (South) the input of the key. If you're using Double Shot 
                  keycaps where the light is allowed to shine directly through the legend, North facing LEDs will light the legend better.
                  If you're using printed keycaps, South facing LEDs make more sense because the light is being blocked by less of the key relative to you.
