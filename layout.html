              <h3>Layout Types: ANSI vs ISO</h3>
              <p>
                The ANSI and ISO keyboard layouts are two of the most popular mechanical keyboard layouts available in the market today. 
                The two layouts have been developed over time to provide users with a more ergonomic experience and improved performance when typing.
                The ANSI layout is more common in North America, while the ISO layout is more common in Europe and other countries. 
                Both layouts offer unique features that can be beneficial depending on your needs. 
                It's important to understand the differences between these two layouts so you can make an informed decision when purchasing a mechanical keyboard.

              <h3>Sizes</h3>
              <p>
                Mechanical keyboards are becoming increasingly popular due to their superior performance and tactile feedback. 
                With the wide variety of mechanical keyboard layouts available, users can choose the size and design that best suits their needs.
                TKL (Tenkeyless) mechanical keyboards are the most common type of mechanical keyboard. 
                These keyboards are smaller than full-sized keyboards, but they still have all the features that a full-sized keyboard would have. 
                They offer a great balance between portability and comfort, making them ideal for gaming or programming.
              </p>
              <p>Below is a quick guide to some different sized keyboards in order from largest to smallest. The smaller keyboard you have, the more
                room you'll have on your desk for your mouse to move.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>100% are full size, traditional keyboards. They include a number pad, F row, and arrowkeys.</p>
              <br>
              <p>A TKL (Tenkeyless) drops the number pad but maintains the same, expanded spacing of the arrow keys and keys like Insert, Delete, 
                Page Up and Page Down. This can also be refered to as an 80% keyboard</p>
              <br>
              <p>A 75% keyboard condenses the TKL layout by removing the extra space around the arrowkeys and shorting the right shift key 
                to be able to have the arrow keys closer to the main typing area.</p>
                <br>
              <p>The 65% drops the Function row completly but maintains the Home and Delete keys</p>
              <br>
              <p>The 60% drops the home, delete, and arrow keys</p>
              <br>
              <p>The 40% is very small and achieves this by dropping the number row and including the letters, and very few other keys</p>
