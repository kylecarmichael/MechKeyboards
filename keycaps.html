              <h3>Profiles</h3>
              <p>
                The world of mechanical keyboards opens you up to a lot of customizability to match your preferences.
                Choosing a keycap profile is a great way to make the keyboard feel and sound better for you, so lets 
                take a look at the differences between some of the most popular keycap profiles.
                Here is a breakdown of the difference profiles:
              </p> 
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Keycap Profile</th>
                  <th>Height</th>
                  <th>Shape</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>SA</td>
                  <td>Tall</td>
                  <td>Sculpted</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>OEM</td>
                  <td>Normal</td>
                  <td>Sculpted</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Cherry</td>
                  <td>Short</td>
                  <td>Sculpted</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>XDA</td>
                  <td>Short</td>
                  <td>Uniform</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>OEM is the standard for most keyboards. Cherry has an agressive angle for easier typing and better access to the F Row.
                Cherry is also one of the most popular profile on after market keycaps.

              <h3>Materials</h3>
              <p>
                PBT, ABS, Metal, and even rubber are all options for what your keys are made out of. The most common being ABS and PBT keycaps. 
                Both are plastic, ABS being the more common and cheaper type. ABS caps can also appear shinier while PBT caps are matte.
                Other materials like rubber, brass, and aluminium are gaining some traction but aren't recommened for someone looking to get started.
