              <h3>Linear, Tactile, and Clicky</h3>
              <p>
                Cherry switches are the most popular and is considered the base line. Gateron is another popular brand and can be compared 
                to Cherrys when looking at the type of switch and activation. Switch type however, exists regardless of brand. 
                There are three switch types: tactile, linear, and clicky. Linear is the most popular and what most cheap mechanical keyboard have installed.
                The three types have different feels to the switch when you press down. Linear travels straight down, tactile has a small bump that 
                activates when the switch is being pressed, and clicky pops a little peice inside of the switch that makes an audible click.
                For Cherry, they have a variety of switches in each catergory but well focus on four. The types of linear switches are red and black, 
                brown is tactile, and blue is clicky.

              <h3>Actuation and Bottom Out</h3>
              <p>
                Actuation is when the switch sends the 'on' signal to the board. 
                Bottom out is when the key hits the literal bottom of the housing/PCB. 
                Actuation happens before bottoming out and has a pressure range for different kinds of switches.
                The amount of pressure you have to apply for a key can change with different switches of the same type.
                For example, Cherry Red switches require less pressure to activate compared to Cherry Black switches, both of these are linear switches.
                In general, Reds are better for speed and gaming, while Blacks are better for accuracy and typing.
