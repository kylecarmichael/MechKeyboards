              <h3>Desk Mats</h3>
              <p>
                If you have used a little napkin sized mouse pad for any length of time, you know it can be frustrating running off the end of it onto
                your desk where the sensor doesn't work quite the way it should. Let me introduce you to the desk mat. It is essentaily a gaint mouse pad 
                that you also place your keyboard on top of. If you've down sized your keyboard from a 100% to even just a TKL, you now have all that space 
                reclaimed for your mouse. This simple change can also aliviate should pain since you'll be sitting at a better angle.

              <h3>Artisan Keys</h3>
              <p>
                Where I would say a desk mat is needed by all and has a lot of function, artisan keycaps are incredibly fun and cool. Normaly they are 
                sculped keycaps that go on the Escape key and living up the whole board. Artisan keys can be anywhere on the spectrum of practical to 
                keys that are too pretty to touch. Other keys recieving attention as custom options are space bars and enter keys.

                <h3>Wrist rests</h3>
                <p>
                  If you've ever had wrist pain, you'd know its not a fate to even wish on one's enemies. The best way to try and prevent this is to pick up
                  a wrist rest. While there is a sliding scale of beauty for wrist rests, all have the functionality of saving you from wrist pain by getting 
                  your hand more level with the keyboard. If you suffer a lot from this issue, you might also want to consider a higher profile for your keycaps,
                  this will bring them closer to you and help prevent a little bit of strain.
